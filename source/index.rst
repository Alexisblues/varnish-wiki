Varnish Web Developer Wiki
==========================

In this wiki we have gathered in one place the best community resources that we
could find that you will need to start using Varnish. Let's get you started from 
development to production!

Varnish is very flexible and as such can be used:

- As a caching engine
- As a load balancer
- As a web application firewall
- As an Edge authentication and authorization mechanism
- For HTTP routing
- For hotlinking protection
- As a DDoS attack defender
- and, a lot, more.

Varnish is a reverse-proxy HTTP accelerator designed for heavily consumed API 
endpoints and also for dynamic, heavy-content, high-traffic websites. It is 
currently used by the likes of Facebook, Wikipedia, Vimeo, Twitter, Tumblr, The 
Guardian, VG.no and many others. More than 2.5 million sites run the software.

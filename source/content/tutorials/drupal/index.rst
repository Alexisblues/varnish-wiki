- Stores its contents in a database (mostly a separate independent database with its own mind)
- All data in a CMS are usually normalized cross databases and servers.
- The design is completely separate from all its contents.

Drupal provides, advanced URL Control, custom content types (e-commerce, blogs, tutorials, newspaper etc),
revision control (same various version of the same page), user management (community, )
This makes a content management system usable by non technical and technical users.

Please note that Drupal 8 supports;

Each new upgrade includes a section about the changes that have been made.

To make your life easier, there is a Script:

VCL Migrator, which can help you upgrade from Varnish 3 to Varnish 4.

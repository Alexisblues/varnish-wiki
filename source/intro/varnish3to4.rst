VCL Migrator
------------

The VCL Migrator is a script named varnish3to4 which will help you migrate from varnish 3 to 4.
There has been quite a lot of syntactical changes in the VCL codes from Varnish 3 to 4.
It is not quite intensive, but using the script to migrate can help save you time and will also point out to you the new changes.
This amis to make your future vcl configuring easier.

You can download the `varnish3to4 script here <https://github.com/fgsch/varnish3to4>_`.

Finally, all details and updates are included in the link. So you may use it at your own responsibility.

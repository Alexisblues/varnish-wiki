The name "Varnish"
==================

The name Varnish comes from when the instigator of Varnish spent a long
time staring at an art-poster with the word “Vernisage” and ended up
checking it in a dictionary, which gives the following three meanings of
the word:

*r.v. var·nished, var·nish·ing, var·nish·es*

    #. *To cover with varnish.*
    #. To give a smooth and glossy finish to.
    #. **To give a deceptively attractive appearance to; gloss over.**

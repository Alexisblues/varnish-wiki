varnish-wiki
============

This project is a Varnish Software initiative for the purpose of creating 
better documentation for the general Web Developer and Varnish Community.
The material supports Varnish Cache and Varnish Cache Plus 4.1.

The live site is currently online: https://www.varnish-software.com/wiki/


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To follow the tutorials, examples and snippets in this wiki, we recommend
the usage of these versions of Varnish:

* Varnish Cache 4.1
* Varnish Cache Plus 4.1

We did our testing we used Ubuntu LTS 16.04 (Xenial).

Building the wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This wiki is a statically generated site. If you want to build it yourself
we recommend you use Ubuntu LTS 16.04 (Xenial) as the OS as well as:

* Python 2.7, pip and friends:
 * easy_install pip
 * pip install sphinx (tested with 1.3.6 and 1.4.8)
 * pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme
 * pip install pygments (2.2.0 or newer)
* Git (to fetch from and send your changes to Github)  

Using CentOS 7, the steps are:

* sudo yum install python-virtualenv
* virtualenv venv
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install sphinx sphinx_bootstrap_theme pygments
* make html # In the wiki source directory

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

Create the static HTML from the GitHub repo
...........................................

1. git clone https://github.com/varnish/varnish-wiki/
2. See the README.rst (this document): https://github.com/varnish/varnish-wiki/blob/master/README.rst
3. Build the static site by using "make html"
4. Test that it works (specially random links and the search function)

You're done. Now you need to upload this to AWS S3 where the wiki is hosted.
